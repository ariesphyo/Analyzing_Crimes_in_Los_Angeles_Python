# Analyzing Crimes in Los Angeles (Python)

Welcome! This Los Angeles crimes data analysis is part of my learning journey as a data analyst at DataCamp.

## Project Description 

The crimes data to be used in this project is provided by a single dataset. It is a modified version of the original data, which is publicly available from Los Angeles Open Data. We have been asked to assist the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) by analyzing crime data to uncover patterns in criminal activity. They intend to use findings to allocate resources more efficiently in addressing crimes across different regions. 

The analysis performs the following tasks: 

1. Which hour has the highest frequency of crimes?
2. Which area has the largest frequency of night crimes (crimes committed between 10pm and 3:59am)?
3. Identify the number of crimes committed against victims of different age groups.
